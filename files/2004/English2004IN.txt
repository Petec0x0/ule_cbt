Each Question carries 3 marks. PASSAGE I:       If, once in a lifetime, you see a blue moon, don`t think your eyes are playing tricks on you. It`s caused by dust in our upper atmosphere; ice crystals are what make you see rings round the moon. Over the centuries, magical powers have been attributed to the moon. It has been said to bring on lunacy, affect the growth of plants, eyes of cats, spots of panthers, functions of women and activities of ghosts. France once had a law against cutting timber except during a waning moon. The moon, and to their gravitational pull. But a common mistake of primitive people is to think that everything timed in the same rhythm as the moon is caused by it. All the moon gazing, probing and measuring has never solved the big problem: its origin. One theory is that it began as a planet, got too near the more massive earth, was ‘captured` and turned into a satellite. Another is that the latter theory is true, scientists say, there would be two clues: the moon would consist of lighter material than the earth, and the earth would be left with a scar. As a matter of fact, the moon does weigh less. And the Pacific Ocean does have a scarlike bottom of basaltic rocks instead of the granite rocks usually found near the earth`s surface. But the assumption that, if man can get to the moon, he`ll find the answer is unfounded. Man has been on the earth hundreds of thousands of years without determining the earth`s origin. Scientists, of course, will never give up either quest. Indeed, for thousands of years the moon has worked a spell of fascination over all the people on its near neighbour, the earth. The ancient worshipped this lamp in the sky and speculated about it endlessly. Modern astronomers continue to explore its mysteries almost every night of the year, and with reason. Ages ago, before artificial light was known, it was important as illumination at night. As everyone knows, the moon has no light of its own; it shines with the cold reflection of the distant sun, but actually the moon is a poor satellite with ‘earth light` sixty times as bright as the best moonlight. That`s why we sometimes see the whole moon faintly when the sun is lighting up only a narrow crescent.

Read passages III and IV carefully and answer the questions that follow. Each question carries 3 marks.PASSAGE III: We knew early in our life that the atmosphere in our home was different from that in many other homes, where husbands and wives quarrel and where there was drunkenness, laziness or indifference – things we never saw in our family. We chafed and grumbled at the strictness of my father`s regime. We went to hide whenever we broke the rules too visibly. We knew, nevertheless, that our parents wanted good things for us. Some of these, such as the insistence on our going to school and never missing a day, we accepted readily enough, although, like most other children, we occasionally yielded to the temptation to play truant. However, in other cases such as their effort to keep us out of contact with the difficult life – the drinking and fighting and beer-brewing and gambling – their failure was inevitable. They could not keep us insulated. By the time we moved about, we were already seeing things with their eyes and judging things by the standards we had absorbed from them. It was borne in on me and my brother at a very early age that our father was an uncommon man. For one thing, in most African families, work around the home was women`s work. So we were vastly impressed by the fact that whenever my mother was away, my father could and did do all her jobs – cooking, cleaning and looking after us. We lived in this way in a community in which housework was regarded as being beneath male dignity. Even in families which, like ours, produced boy after boy – our sister came fifth – it simply meant that the mother carried a greater and greater burden of work. In our family, nevertheless, the boys did girl`s work and my father did it with us. One of the prime chores of life in the family was fetching water from the pump down the street, some two hundred metres from our door. Since the pump was not unlocked until six in the morning and there was always crowding, a system had developed whereby you got out before dawn, placed your twenty-litre tin in line, and then went home, returning later to take your place. Often, of course, tins would be moved back in line and others moved ahead. This could be corrected if none of those in front were too big a challenge. When taps were substituted for the pumps, the first one installed was nearly a kilometre away from our house and we had to make the treck with the water tins balanced on our heads -- and indignity because this was the way girls, not proud males, carried their burdens. All the children in the neibghbourhood knew we did women`s work and I can still hear their derisive laughter. We did our jobs doggedly, that notwithstanding, because our father and mother expected it of us. Out of choice our father did everything we did, including fetching water on the occasion, and commanded us by sheer force of his example.

Out of choice our father did everything we did, including fetching water on the occasion, and commanded us by sheer force of his example.    									 
Read passages III and IV carefully and answer the questions that follow. Each question carries 3 marks.PASSAGE III: We knew early in our life that the atmosphere in our home was different from that in many other homes, where husbands and wives quarrel and where there was drunkenness, laziness or indifference – things we never saw in our family. We chafed and grumbled at the strictness of my father`s regime. We went to hide whenever we broke the rules too visibly. We knew, nevertheless, that our parents wanted good things for us. Some of these, such as the insistence on our going to school and never missing a day, we accepted readily enough, although, like most other children, we occasionally yielded to the temptation to play truant. However, in other cases such as their effort to keep us out of contact with the difficult life – the drinking and fighting and beer-brewing and gambling – their failure was inevitable. They could not keep us insulated. By the time we moved about, we were already seeing things with their eyes and judging things by the standards we had absorbed from them. It was borne in on me and my brother at a very early age that our father was an uncommon man. For one thing, in most African families, work around the home was women`s work. So we were vastly impressed by the fact that whenever my mother was away, my father could and did do all her jobs – cooking, cleaning and looking after us. We lived in this way in a community in which housework was regarded as being beneath male dignity. Even in families which, like ours, produced boy after boy – our sister came fifth – it simply meant that the mother carried a greater and greater burden of work. In our family, nevertheless, the boys did girl`s work and my father did it with us. One of the prime chores of life in the family was fetching water from the pump down the street, some two hundred metres from our door. Since the pump was not unlocked until six in the morning and there was always crowding, a system had developed whereby you got out before dawn, placed your twenty-litre tin in line, and then went home, returning later to take your place. Often, of course, tins would be moved back in line and others moved ahead. This could be corrected if none of those in front were too big a challenge. When taps were substituted for the pumps, the first one installed was nearly a kilometre away from our house and we had to make the treck with the water tins balanced on our heads -- and indignity because this was the way girls, not proud males, carried their burdens.

PASSAGE IV A Wolf, seeing a Lamb drinking from a river, wanted to find a pretext for devouring him. He stood higher up the stream and accused the lamb of muddying the water so that he could not drink. The lamb said that he drank only with tip of his tongue, and that in any case he was standing lower down the river, and could not possibly disturb the water higher up. When this excuse failed him, the wolf said: ‘Well, last year you insulted my father.` ‘I wasn`t even born then,` replied the lamb. ‘You are good at finding answers, ‘said the wolf, ‘but what do you mean by taking up so much of the path where I am walking? The lamb, frightened at the wolf`s angry tone and terrible aspect, told him, with all due submission, that he could not conceive how his walking on such a wide path could occasion him inconvenience. ‘What!` exclaimed the wolf, seemingly in great anger and indignation. ‘You are as impudent as your father who seized me by the throat last year, and caused me to be kept in a cage for three months.` ‘If you will believe me,` said the lamb, ‘my parents are poor simple creatures who live entirely by green stuff; we are none of us hunters of your species.` ‘Ah! I see it`s no use talking to you, ‘said the wolf, drawing up close to him. ‘It runs in the blood of your family to hate us wolves, and therefore, as we have come so conveniently together, I`ll just pay off a few of your forefathers` scores before we part. ‘So saying, he leapt at the lamb from behind and garroted him.
